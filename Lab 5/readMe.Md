# Traffic Flow Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project focuses on building and training a neural network to predict traffic congestion levels using historical traffic data, weather conditions, and time-related features. The implementation uses Python and modern machine learning libraries.

## **Features**
1. **Time-series Forecasting**:
   - Predicts traffic congestion levels based on historical traffic flow, weather, and time features.
2. **Integration of Weather Data**:
   - Incorporates temperature, humidity, and precipitation to improve accuracy.
3. **Visual Insights**:
   - Generates plots for traffic trends and the impact of weather on congestion.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes:
- **Traffic Flow**: Number of vehicles passing through a specific point.
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, and precipitation levels.
- **Time Features**: Day of the week, hour of the day, etc.

If a real dataset is unavailable, simulated data or open datasets from similar cities can be used.
